This is basically an attempt to clone the NYT crossword webapp, with some extended features hopefully.


## steps

- [ ] backend (another repo probably)
  - [ ] SQL crossword definition
  - [ ] modeling
  - [ ] API
- [ ] frontend
  - [ ] actually getting this to work
    - [ ] letters showing up in a grid of some sort
    - [ ] test puzzles
  - [ ] styling
- [ ] "extended features"
  - [ ] Across Lite parsing
  - [ ] creation mode (or solving mode, whichever I don't implement first)
  - [ ] fun little sound effect plays on successful solve
